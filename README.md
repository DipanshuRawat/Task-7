## ðŸ“Œ Other Alternatives to Netdata

| Tool | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| Prometheus + Grafana | Very powerful and flexible, but complex to setup compared to Netdata. |
| Zabbix | Full enterprise-grade monitoring, heavier and more resource-intensive. |
| Datadog | Commercial SaaS monitoring platform, very feature-rich, but expensive. |
| Nagios | Traditional IT infrastructure monitoring, more basic graphs. |
| New Relic | Cloud-based monitoring mainly focused on applications. |

## ðŸ“Œ Why Netdata Over Other Alternatives?

- **Ease of Installation**: Single line install; Prometheus/Grafana need complex setup.
- **Real-time Data**: Prometheus scrapes at intervals (15s, 30s) â€” Netdata updates every second.
- **Automatic Detection**: No manual configuration of exporters or agents.
- **Visualization Built-in**: No need to install separate dashboard software (like Grafana).
- **Free**: Unlike Datadog or New Relic which charge per host.
- **Perfect for Quick Troubleshooting**: Identify issues before even opening logs.

## ðŸ“Œ Best Practices for Using Netdata

- **Persist Configuration**: If using Docker, mount `/etc/netdata` to a volume.
- **Enable Alerts**: Configure email/mobile notifications for critical KPIs (CPU >90%, Disk <10%, Service Down).
- **Optimize Storage**: Tune how long you retain metrics, especially on low storage servers.
- **Claim Nodes to Netdata Cloud**: For easy centralized monitoring of all your servers.
- **Limit Public Exposure**: Run Netdata behind a firewall or with authentication if exposed to internet.
- **Integrate with External Systems**: Push Netdata metrics to Prometheus or other databases if needed.
- **Keep Netdata Updated**: New plugins and collectors get added very often.

## ðŸ“Œ How to Use Netdata

### 1. Install Netdata
- Bare Metal:  
  ```bash
  bash <(curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart.sh)
  ```

- Docker:
  ```bash
  docker run -d --name=netdata \
    -p 19999:19999 \
    --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE \                      
    --security-opt apparmor=unconfined \
    netdata/netdata
  ```

```
--cap-add=SYS_PTRACE

``` 
- This provide some extra permission to netdata

```
--security-opt apparmor=unconfined

``` 
- Run this container without AppArmor restrictions. Basically, you are disabling AppArmor for that container.

### 2. Access Dashboard
- Open your browser at:  
  `http://<your-server-ip>:19999`
